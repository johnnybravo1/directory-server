DS Docker Image Help
====================

Getting started
---------------

Use the following Docker command to start the server:

    docker run --rm -it \
        --env DS_SET_UID_ADMIN_AND_MONITOR_PASSWORDS=true \
        --env DS_UID_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password \
        --env DS_UID_MONITOR_PASSWORD=password \
        --mount type=bind,src=/path/to/secrets,dst=/opt/opendj/secrets \
        DS-IMAGE start-ds

A keystore is **required** in order to start the server and must be present
in `/path/to/secrets`. See the section "Volumes and secrets" for more details.

The server has two administrative accounts, `uid=admin` and `uid=monitor`,
which are deactivated by default. They are enabled by providing passwords
as shown above. When using Kubernetes a more secure approach is to provision
the passwords using the `initialize-only` command in an "init" container.

Commands
--------

    start-ds            Initializes (see below) and then starts the server.
                        A keystore is required in order to use this command.
                        See "Getting Started" below.
    
    initialize-only     Initializes the server and then terminates. This
                        command is suitable for use in Kubernetes "init"
                        containers where long running tasks such as
                        database indexing are allowed. The initialization
                        process first checks if there is any persisted data
                        in the "data" directory and, if not, it bootstraps
                        the content from the Docker image itself. It then
                        performs an upgrade and then rebuilds any missing
                        indexes. A keystore is required in order to use this
                        command.
    
    dev                 Starts the container in developer mode. No 
                        initialization will be performed, nor will the server
                        be started. Instead, the container will just wait
                        until it receives a stop signal from Kubernetes.
                        Use this command to build custom DS images. See the
                        next section for more information.
                        
    help                Displays this help.
    
    CMD [ARG...]        Runs an arbitrary command with arguments. Performs
                        minimal intialization before running the command.
                        In particular, it will not bootstrap the data from
                        the Docker image, nor run upgrade or rebuild degraded
                        indexes. This mode is suitable for custom init
                        containers that may want to initialize data from
                        sources other than the Docker image, e.g. from backups
                        or by importing LDIF files.

Environment variables
---------------------

DS containers can be parameterized at run-time using the following environment
variables:

    DS_GROUP_ID                         The group ID, which usually identifies
                                        the data center or region in which the
                                        server is located. Servers prefer
                                        connecting to other servers having the
                                        same group ID. Default: "default".
    
    DS_SERVER_ID                        A unique identifier for the server
                                        which will identify the server within
                                        a deployment. Default: HOSTNAME.
                                        
    DS_ADVERTISED_LISTEN_ADDRESS        The advertised address(es) which 
                                        clients should use for connecting 
                                        to this server. Default: FQDN.
                                        
    DS_BOOTSTRAP_REPLICATION_SERVERS    The addresses of one or more servers 
                                        within the deployment which this 
                                        server should connect to in order to 
                                        discover the rest of the deployment. 
                                        Default is aligned with Kubernetes
                                        stateful set naming conventions:
                                        <statefulset-name>-0.<domain-name>,
                                        <statefulset-name>-1.<domain-name>

    DS_SET_UID_ADMIN_AND_MONITOR_PASSWORDS Set to true in order to set the
                                        admin and monitor passwords before
                                        intializing or starting the server.

    DS_USE_PRE_ENCODED_PASSWORDS        By default the admin and monitor
                                        passwords are provided as plain-text.
                                        Set this to true if the passwords have
                                        been pre-encoded externally.

    DS_UID_ADMIN_PASSWORD               This variable should contain the
                                        plain-text password or pre-encoded
                                        password for the uid=admin account.
                                        If it is not set then fetch the
                                        password from a file instead.

    DS_UID_ADMIN_PASSWORD_FILE          This variable should contain the
                                        name of a file, relative to
                                        /opt/opendj, containing the plain-text
                                        password or pre-encoded password for
                                        the uid=admin account. Defaults to
                                        secrets/admin.pwd.

    DS_UID_MONITOR_PASSWORD             This variable should contain the
                                        plain-text password or pre-encoded
                                        password for the uid=monitor account.
                                        If it is not set then fetch the
                                        password from a file instead.

    DS_UID_MONITOR_PASSWORD_FILE        This variable should contain the
                                        name of a file, relative to
                                        /opt/opendj, containing the plain-text
                                        password or pre-encoded password for
                                        the uid=monitor account. Defaults to
                                        secrets/monitor.pwd.

    DS_CLUSTER_TOPOLOGY                 An optional comma separated list of
                                        cluster region names where DJ is
                                        deployed.
                                        Used by multi region deployments,
                                        it is assumed service names in each
                                        region have suffixes matching the
                                        region, and are a subdomain of the pod
                                        FQDN.
                                        For all pods in a cluster, DS_GROUP_ID
                                        is changed to the cluster name;
                                        DS_SERVER_ID is changed to include pod
                                        and cluster name, for uniqueness
                                        purposes.
                                        DS_BOOTSTRAP_REPLICATION_SERVERS is
                                        also changed to include one pod per
                                        region cluster.

Volumes and secrets
-------------------

DS containers use the following directories which may be mounted at run-time:

    /opt/opendj/config          Contains the configuration, including
                                schema in the "schema" sub-directory.
                                
                                This directory should be copied out to
                                development environment when building
                                custom images (see above).
                                
    /opt/opendj/data            Contains run-time persisted data, such as
                                database files and replication changelog
                                files. This directory will not usually be
                                mounted in dev environments, where data
                                is discarded when the container stops.
                                In production environments this directory
                                must be mounted from an external persistent
                                volume.
                                
    /opt/opendj/secrets         Contains the PKCS12 "keystore" file and its
                                PIN in "keystore.pin". The keystore file must
                                contain three secrets, the CA public key with
                                the alias "ca-cert", the SSL key pair with the
                                alias "ssl-key-pair" and signed by the CA,
                                and the RSA master key pair, with the alias 
                                "master-key", which should be used for 
                                protecting and distributing any generated 
                                symmetric keys.
                                
                                The CA and master key-pair must be the same
                                on all servers in the deployment.
                                
                                Note that derived images may have different
                                requirements in terms of secrets. For example,
                                the keystore PIN may be obtained from an
                                environment variable, or the master key may
                                be obtained from a service like KMS.

Network ports
-------------

DS containers expose the following network ports:

    4444    The LDAPS administration port.
    1389    The LDAP port, supporting StartTLS.
    1636    The LDAPS port.
    8080    The HTTP port.
    8443    The HTTPS port.
    8989    The TLS protected replication port.

All TLS enabled ports support TLSv1.3 and are protected with the SSL key-pair
found in the PKCS12 keystore (see the previous section).
